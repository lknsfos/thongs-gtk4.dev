# 👙 ThongSSH

**Minimalist. Sexy. Secure.**

Welcome to **ThongSSH** — the lightest and hottest SSH/Telnet/SFTP client for Linux.

Just like the perfect pair of thongs, this client is barely there, but it holds everything together (your connections!) perfectly. No bulky "granny panty" interface here, just pure functionality and pleasure.

## ✨ About the Look

ThongSSH is for those who love minimalism. We’ve got a cute host panel so you never lose track of your servers.

### 🛠️ The Fabric (Tech Stack)
Stitched together with the latest fashion trends:
* **Python 3.13+** (Fresh and hot 🔥)
* **GTK 4.2** (Smooth and sleek interface)

## ⚠️ WARNING: Experimental Zone

Listen, let's be real:

1.  **100% AI Generated:** This whole thing was written by AI (my digital besties 🤖). Humans barely touched the keyboard.
2.  **Pre-Alpha / Experimental:** It’s not even beta, it’s a "fitting session". It might feel tight, it might slip, or it might crash when you least expect it. Use at your own risk!
3.  **Security:** We tried, but the code audit was done by electric sheep.

## 📦 Packages & Updates

When will we get `.deb` or `.rpm`?
> *Ugh, don't pressure me!* 💅

Updates and packages will happen **someday**. Maybe. If the vibe is right. For now — clone it, run from source, and enjoy the thrill.

## 🚀 How to Run (For the brave)

Make sure you have the latest Python and GTK4 installed.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:lknsfos/thongs-gtk4.dev.git
cd thongs-gtk4.dev
python3 main.py
```
